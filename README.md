## How To Run
1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies. You will have to install Yarn if you haven't already, using `npm i -g yarn`, for this to work.
2. Optionally, if you have VS Code, run `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks` to install some stuff to make VS Code work with Yarn.
3. Start a MongoDB instance. Remote (i.e. Atlas) instances should work.
4. Populate the config.yaml based on config.yaml.example.
5. Run `yarn dev` to try it out on port 3000.
