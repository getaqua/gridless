## How To Run
1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies. You will have to install Yarn if you haven't already, using `npm i -g yarn`, for this to work.
2. Start a MongoDB instance. Remote (i.e. Atlas) instances should work.
3. Populate the config.yaml based on config.yaml.example.
4. Run `yarn dev` to try it out on port 3000.
